  <ul>
    <li><strong>Character:</strong> Nocthera (or Nox)</li>
    <li><strong>Race:</strong> Glassborn (Hybrid of Fire and Earth)</li>
    <li><strong>Class:</strong> Druid (Circle of Stars)</li>
    <li><strong>Home Biome:</strong> North/North Western Mountains. From a cratered village in a broken caldera called <em>Vitrakor‚Äôs Eye</em>, found in the <em>Cragspine</em> mountains between goat and lava snail.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    On the fourth night of her journey alone, Nocthera found the absence of sound just a bit unnerving.
    As the third of five siblings, she had always fallen asleep cradled in the music of her family‚Äôs nightly orchestration:
    the subharmonic thrumming of her elder brother‚Äôs breathing and the delicate chime-murmurs of her younger kin.
    Without them, the silence feels too sharp, too hollow‚Ä¶ like sleeping within a levitating shard of tempered obsidian above
    a still ritual pool, alive with energy but effecting nothing.
  </p>

  <p>
    She attuned to the trickling of the stream nearby, letting it serve as her sleeping draught. There was always something telling its story to fall asleep to.
    In the winters of her home in Cragspine, when the fires burned low, the glass in the walls would begin to crackle;
    soft, uneven, like the sound of her sister tiptoeing off to meet ‚Äújust a friend,‚Äù trying not to wake anyone.
    She chuckled at that, shaking her head.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fire had sputtered out in the night, only damp ash and a few buried embers remained. She stirred them absently with a stick ‚Äî not to cook, not yet,
    it was just something to do with her hands. The ashen smell rose up anyway: smoke-sweet resin, kiln-baked fruit,
    the faint tang of scorched quartz<sup>1</sup>.
  </p>

  <p>
    She shook out her bedwrap, rolled it tight. Checked the straps on her pack. It was habit. When you grow up in a house full of people, movement finds you early.
    Their home had always moved like that too. In no way frantic, but simply because it was filled with life.
  </p>

  <p>
    Both parents were often away, not distant, just driven. Her mother, a forge-artificer, maintained the caldera‚Äôs pressure channels
    and kept the resonance wells aligned. Her father, wise, measured and broad-shouldered, served on the civic watch and sat in council when called upon.
    They moved as a unit, no one led, no one followed; bound more by rhythm than roles.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rovan, the eldest, picked up the rest without complaint. He helped patch the heating channels when they split,
    handled trade runs, made sure everyone was fed and dressed. All while apprenticing in his mother‚Äôs trade:
    micro-welding lens fittings, thermic routing, and shaping glass that would eventually be used in focussing <em>elementa</em>.
    Still, he never missed a beat at home.
  </p>

  <p>
    She looked back at the camp <em>before</em> departing into the twilight of the dawn. A small glint of one of the covered embers caught her eye.
    It made her think of what Rovan had once said:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to burn the brightest to matter or to be noticed in a way that matters. The hottest kilns keep their fire sealed. Theirs is the warmth that endures.‚Äù
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    It stuck. The way only truth does, when it's lived as much as said.

    üí† <strong>Footnote 1:</strong> Quartz, especially clear or smoky, could be <em>ritually scorched</em> over focused flame in the kiln.
    In Glassborn culture, where harmonic rituals and tonal stillness matter, this is what was known as a resonance purge ‚Äî
    a way to clear lingering thoughts from the day, reset the house‚Äôs stillness, and prepare the space for sleep.
