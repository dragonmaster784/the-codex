  <h3>🌀 Glassborn Cultural Aside: Resonant Attunement</h3>
  <p>
    Among the Glassborn, words are often considered too blunt to carry true meaning alone. So they tune themselves instead — not in pitch, but in intention. Their speech is accompanied by subtle hums, pulses, and tonal shifts, barely perceptible to outsiders...

  <h3>👁️ Glassborn Sensory Traits: Light & Vibration</h3>
  <p>
    Though brittle in body, the Glassborn are born with senses as refined as their origins; tempered by heat, sharpened under pressure, and attuned to the silent forces that shape the world...
  </p>

  <h3>🧬 Glassborn Physiology & Development</h3>
  <p>
    Glassborn are a heritable hybrid lineage, descended from ancestral unions of fire and earth elementals...
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Obsidian:</strong> Deep black or maroon, fast heat recovery, tends toward emotional volatility</li>
    <li><strong>Smoky Quartz:</strong> Grey-brown translucent, strong vibration sensitivity, hyperactive, prone to sensory overload</li>
    <li><strong>Onyx:</strong> Opaque black with reflective veining, physically dense, slow resonance shift</li>
    <li><strong>Amberglass:</strong> Golden-orange tones, rapid heat dispersion, more emotionally expressive</li>
    <li><strong>Berylcryst:</strong> Pale blue or green, more brittle, but heightened harmonic sensitivity</li>
    <li><strong>Labradorite:</strong> Deep blue with hues of green, purple, and gold flecks. More ethereal in presence, wonderers and dreamers.</li>
    <li><strong>Opal:</strong> Semi translucent white, with orange and green flecks. Vibrant, energetic, centered, but sometimes self-centered.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>💠 Birthstone Phenomenon</h3>
  <p>
    When a Glassborn is delivered, the final pulse of life force causes a sudden surge of internal heat...

  <h3>🩻 Chronic Condition: Microfracturing</h3>
  <p>
    All Glassborn experience a physiological process called lattice stress cycling — the periodic buildup and release of tension within their mineral-matrix body structure...

  <h3>🧠 Mental Health: Shattersleep</h3>
  <p>
    While their bodies fracture under stress, their minds are just as sensitive to overload. A traumatic shock, physical or emotional, can trigger a neurological condition known in medical druidic terms as Neuro-Crystalline Dissonance (NCD), but more commonly referred to as Shattersleep...
