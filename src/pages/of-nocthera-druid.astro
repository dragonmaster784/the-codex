    Nocthera never thought of herself as a scholar. Not in the way the mages and druids of the floating cities might define it,
    with scrolls and sanctums and silver-etched robes. But still, she studied. In the quiet way that someone learns a melody singing it
    because it brings them a simple happiness.
  </p>

  <p>
    Her studies began long before she ever realised they were studies… in the long nights lying still beside her siblings,
    listening for the moment when the house slipped from motion to rest. In the way her mother’s hand would hover an inch above the kilnstone
    before calling its heat forward. In the way Rovan whispered things twice: once to remember them, and once to set them in place.
  </p>

  <p>
    She had no temple. Her first constellations were mapped on soot-stained rafters, with charcoal and dry moss.
    Nocthera learned to read the stars not by name, but by cadence — how long it took one to rise behind the lip of the caldera,
    how many breaths it stayed before blinking out behind the ash line. She didn’t seek meaning from them. But she noticed when they returned,
    and how some came back <em>different</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Her druidic teachings, such as they were, began in the soft twilight hours between work and sleep, when her grandmother Lirae
    would beckon her to the roof and trace skypaths with a sootstick on slate.
    Lirae had been part of a long-quiet Circle of the Stars — now few in number, but still rooted in the village’s memory.
    She spoke little of titles, even less of destiny, but her hands were always warm, and her eyes always knew where to look.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “We don’t ask the stars to speak,” she’d say. “We listen to how they hold their silence.”
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    After Lirae passed, her star map passed to Nocthera. She began spending more time in the Selenarium —
    a half-cracked dome observatory built before the last tremor cracked the valley wall.
    It was shared by three druidic circles:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>The Verdant Coil</strong>, who tended the crater’s surviving flora.</li>
    <li><strong>The Molten Eye</strong>, whose rites involved volcanic pressure and geomancy / elemancy.</li>
    <li><strong>The Celestine Thread</strong>, a fragment of the old Circle of Stars.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The village did not formally revere them, but neither did it interfere. They were seen as necessary balance to the more volatile artificers
    and elementa-driven commerce that powered the town’s pulse.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nocthera split her time between the Selenarium and the elementech labs, where scraps of cooled starmetal and refracted dust
    could be borrowed for calibrating her star map. Her path was unusual — part intuition, part toolcraft.
    She learned to chart the sky in motion, not as a mystic rite, but as a discipline of presence:
    each point recorded not to predict, but to notice.
  </p>

  <p>
    The druids of the Celestine Thread didn’t all walk the same line: some sang to stars in reverence, others sketched in silence.
    A few used telescopic staves, augmented by slow-spinning crystals that filtered false light.
    They studied with wonder, not worship. It suited her.
  </p>

  <p>
    Her starmap orb began as a project for calibration — a practical exercise in internalising celestial movement.
    But over time, it became something quieter, more personal. A companion; flawed, finicky, sometimes wrong…
    but responsive in a way she trusted.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Circle of Stars, to Nocthera, is not a forgotten order. It is a continuation. A thread passed from elder to child,
    from slate to shard, from night to night — each keeping the sky just a little more understood… known.
